Traditional Zettelkasten requires manual linking between notes, which creates friction. What if an AI assistant automatically:

1. Analyzed new notes against existing ones
2. Suggested connections with confidence scores
3. Maintained bidirectional links automatically
4. Identified clusters of related concepts

The human just captures thoughts. The AI maintains the graph.

This could solve the "maintenance burden" problem that kills most personal knowledge management systems. The value comes from capture and retrieval, not from manual organization.

**Open question:** Would automated linking reduce the depth of understanding that comes from manually connecting ideas?
