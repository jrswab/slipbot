Compound interest is the most powerful force in finance. Small, consistent returns over long periods create exponential growth that's counterintuitive to our linear thinking.

Key insight: It's not about the rate of return, it's about the time invested. 10% returns over 50 years beats 20% returns over 20 years.

The math is simple but the psychology is hard. Most people underestimate long-term compounding and overestimate short-term gains.
